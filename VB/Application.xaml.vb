' Developer Express Code Central Example:
' Binding Master and Detail focused rows to ViewModel objects
' 
' This example demonstrates how to use ViewModel properties to track and control
' focused row changes both for Master and Detail grids. This capability is
' achieved by creating attached behavior that handles all necessary events
' (especially for the focused view and row changing, both in the detail and master
' grids). The logic of focusing rows can be changed inside this behavior depending
' on your requirements. For example, you may want not to focus the first detail
' row when a master row is expanded. If so, change the MasterRowExpanded event
' handler as follows:
' 
' void MasterGridMasterRowExpanded(object sender,
' RowEventArgs e)
' {  (MasterGrid.GetDetail(MasterView.FocusedRowHandle) as
' GridControl).View.FocusedRow = null;
' }
' 
' 
' 
' 
' So, the main idea of the example is
' to show how the row focusing logic can be defined in the GridControl that
' operates in Master-Detail mode.
' 
' Important note:the approach shown in the
' example will work only with the DataControlDetailDescriptor, as other
' descriptors use custom templates to display detail content that is not
' synchronized with the master grid.
